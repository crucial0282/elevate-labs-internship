## Best Practices Learned:

1. **Use at least 12â€“16 characters.**
2. **Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.**
3. **Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns** (e.g., "qwerty", "1234").
4. **Place numbers/symbols in the middle**, not just at the ends.
5. **Avoid repeating or sequential characters** (like "aaa", "123", "abc").

## Common Password Attacks:

* **Brute Force:** Tries every possible combination. Long, complex passwords are harder to crack.
* **Dictionary Attacks:** Tries common words or leaked passwords. Avoid using real words.
* **Credential Stuffing:** Uses leaked username-password combos. Always use unique passwords for each account.
* **Social Engineering:** Based on guessing from personal information. Avoid birthdays, pet names, etc.

## Conclusion:

Password complexity greatly increases resistance to attacks. The most secure passwords are long, random, and diverse in character types. Tools like PasswordMeter help visualize weaknesses and improve password hygiene.
